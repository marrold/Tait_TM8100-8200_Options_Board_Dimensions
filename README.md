# Tait TM8100/8200 Options Board Dimensions

I've created an SVG of the Tait TM8100 and TM8200 Options Board Dimensions with a view of using it to create custom Options PCBs, and shared it here for posterity. 

Fortunately the drawings in the included "3DK Hardware Developer’s Kit Application Manual" PDF are to scale so it was just a case of converting it SVG, scaling it, and removing some of the cruft. 

I've not yet verified the fit by having a PCB manufactured, but all measurements match those documented in the PDF.
